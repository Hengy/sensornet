SensorNet Arduino Library & Template
--------------------------------------------
Using the included library and template, an Arduino-based sensor or automation control can be developed in very little time.


Supported Arduino Hardware
--------------------------------------------
The following is a list of currently supported hardware, as well as hardware that is planned to be supported in the future.

Arduino UNO - all revisions, as well as Sparkfun's RedBoard
*Arduino Leonardo
*Arduino Mega
*Arduino Micro
*Sparkfun Arduino Pro Micro
*Arduino Mini
*Arduino Pro Mini
*Arduino Nano
*Arduino Fio
*Arduino Pro

*marked Arduinos are planned for future support. Unlisted Arduinos may only require minimal code changes.


Template
--------------------------------------------
The included template Arduino sketch includes the basic code for compatability with SensorNet.
