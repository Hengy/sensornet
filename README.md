Sensornet

Sensornet is a wireless network, optimised for small data transfers that are typical of sensor and automation devices. Where the 802.11 standard (WiFi) is meant for large data streams, networking, etc. - and the overhead that comes with it - Sensornet is optimised for the inherently small data needed for sensors and automation control.

For example, the data requirements of the typical sensor is from 1 bit (open/closed) to 24 bits (8-bit representation of a colour). Automation has similar requirements - fron 1 bit (on/off) control, to 36 bits (12-bit PWM control of a RGB light).


Sensornet provides a common API for multiple microcontroller architectures, allowing simple transfer and management of sensor and automation control data, as well as web-based control centred around the inexpensive, but powerful Raspberry Pi platform.
