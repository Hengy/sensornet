SensorNet
-----------------------------------------------

SensorNet is a wireless network optimised for small data transfers that are typical of sensor and automation devices. Where the 802.11 standard (WiFi) is meant for large data streams, networking, etc. - with the overhead that comes with it - Sensornet is optimised for the inherently small data needed for sensors and automation control.

The data requirements of the typical sensor is from 1 bit (open/closed) to 24 bits (8-bit representation of a colour). Automation has similar requirements - fron 1 bit (on/off) control, to 36 bits (12-bit PWM control of a RGB light).

Sensornet provides a common API for multiple microcontroller architectures, allowing simple transfer and management of sensor and automation control data, as well as a web-based interface centred around the inexpensive, but powerful Raspberry Pi platform.

Using the SensorNet libraries and templates, rapid development of SensorNet compatible sensors and automation controls is possible in as little as a few hours, while access to advanced features allow for complex, smart devices with advanced functionality.
